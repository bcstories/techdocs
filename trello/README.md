# How we're using Trello

If you're new to trello, read [this quick doc](https://trello.com/guide/trello-101)

Effective trello-ing means **updating the board _frequently_**
Update the board every time you begin, complete, or hit a milestone in a task.

### In our project:
**Lists:** Categories of tasks like "Base model" and "Cars"

**Cards:** Small tasks like "Turn DEM data into mesh" and "Road placement". If a card is a big task, make it two cards. One person per card.

**Checklists:** Exist within a card. Use for subtasks and to show progress.

### Make it yours
Trello is an effective tool when we all use it and write cards in ways that communicate what we're doing easily.
