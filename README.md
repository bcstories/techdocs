# **Note** techdocs has moved to the gitlab

# techdocs
Technical documentation for the project. Only how-to's & resources go here, not assets.

Write documents that will both **a)** remind you how you did something and **b)** help others avoid common pitfalls

### Text-based resources are preferred to videos

Github has web support for [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which makes editing docs from the web smooth. [Here's a nice markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis).
