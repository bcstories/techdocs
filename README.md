# techdocs
Technical documentation for the project. Only how-to's & resources go here, not assets.

Write documents that will both a) help you remeber to do something if you come back to it later and b) point others in the right direction to hopefully avoid common pitfalls

### Text-based resources are preferred to videos

Github online uses [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is nice for easily formatting text and adding other media. [Here's a nice markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis). This is nice for editing how-to's from the web.
